# Flask Mega-Tutorial

My repository for Miguel Grinberg's Mega-Tutorial code 
[Link to tutorial](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world)

This is a microblogging application build with Flask that let's user publish posts, change their profile and register as a new user. It is still work in progress.

I have used [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for code formatting.

### Built With
Major components that I have used in building this application,
complete list should be released when I deploy to Heroku.
* [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)
* [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/)
* [WTForms](https://wtforms.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

I have used VirtualEnv for this application, so by the end of tutorial I should have a file with all requirements listed.
By now you need to create your own VirtualEnv and install all dependecies manually.


### Installation
1. Clone my repo ```git clone https://github.com/pomyslowynick/flask_megatutorial```
2. TODO...
